## Slides
Run `npm install && npm run start` to start the slideshow [locally](http://127.0.0.1:8080)



## Tasks

The tasks for the workshop are found [here](src/tasks/)

The start of each `task` file contains information on what you are required to do.

`task` files are often accompanied with a `depend` file. The depend file will often contain compile errors. These errors can be fixed by modifying the `task` file.
