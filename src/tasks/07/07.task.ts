/**
 * typed-web-workers creates web-workers

 *
 * Without looking online at the documentation,
 * and only using the typing information provided
 * by the library:
 *
 * create a worker that accepts a number as input and
 * returns that number multiplied by 10.
 *
 * The returned number should be logged to the console.
 *
 * Send the number 100 to the web-worker
 *
 * After completing this, update the typed-web-worker library
 * to the newest version (2.1.1)
